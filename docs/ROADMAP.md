# Roadmap (v0 → v1)

This is a living plan. Items may shift as we learn.

## v0.x

- Stabilize CRUD flows across CRM entities
- Bulk import from CSV (leads) with mapping UI
- Better filters and sorts (by owner, stage, date)
- Inline edit and quick actions
- Activity linking to related records (deep links)
- More exports (contacts/accounts CSV)
- Accessibility pass (keyboard navigation, contrasts)

## v1.0

- Pluggable app registry (beyond CRM)
- Custom fields per entity (schema‑lite approach)
- Saved views and simple reporting
- File attachments (browser sandboxed)
- Theming and basic customization (logo, colors)
- Portable bundles for backup/restore

## Stretch

- PWA packaging (optional; still file:// friendly)
- Background sync adapters (user‑controlled)
- WebCrypto‑backed local encryption (key managed by user)
