# Copilot usage rules (public repo)

- Do not suggest or commit secrets, API keys, or personal data
- Avoid generating machine-specific paths or IPs
- When proposing tasks, prefer generic commands; do not add `.vscode/tasks.json` here
- For private configurations, reference the private repo as documented in `PRIVATE_REPO_SETUP.md`

## Dual-remote workflow hints

- Public remote: `origin`
- Private remote: `private`
- Keep sensitive tasks/envs in the private repo only
