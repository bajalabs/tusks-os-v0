Place the following files in this folder for fully offline SQLite (sql.js):

Required files (exact names):
- sql-wasm.js
- sql-wasm.wasm

Where to get them:
- Official releases: https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js/releases
- CDN (for manual download): https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sql.js@1.10.2/dist/

After copying, reopen tusk-os-static/apps/start.html (file://). The app will load these local files instead of the CDN.
